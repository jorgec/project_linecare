Blood consists of three types of cells suspended in fluid called plasma: white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), and platelets (PLTs). They are produced and mature primarily in the bone marrow and, under normal circumstances, are released into the bloodstream as needed.\r\n\r\nA CBC is typically performed using an automated instrument that measures various parameters, including counts of the cells that are present in a person's sample of blood. The results of a CBC can provide information about not only the number of cell types but also can give an indication of the physical characteristics of some of the cells. A standard CBC includes the following:\r\n\r\nEvaluation of white blood cells: WBC count; may or may not include a WBC differential\r\nEvaluation of red blood cells: RBC count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct) and RBC indices, which includes mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and red cell distribution width (RDW). The RBC evaluation may or may not include reticulocyte count.\r\nEvaluation of platelets: platelet count; may or may not include mean platelet volume (MPV) and/or platelet distribution width (PDW)\r\nSignificant abnormalities in one or more of the blood cell populations can indicate the presence of one or more conditions. Typically other tests are performed to help determine the cause of abnormal results. Often, this requires visual confirmation by examining a blood smear under a microscope. A trained laboratorian can evaluate the appearance and physical characteristics of the blood cells, such as size, shape and color, noting any abnormalities that may be present. Any additional information is noted and reported to the healthcare provider. This information gives the health practitioner additional clues as to the cause of abnormal CBC results.	To determine your general health status; to screen for, diagnose, or monitor any one of a variety of diseases and conditions that affect blood cells, such as anemia, infection, inflammation, bleeding disorder or cancer	As part of a routine medical exam; when you have signs and symptoms that may be related to a condition that affects blood cells; at regular intervals to monitor treatment or when you are receiving treatment known to affect blood cells	A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or a fingerstick or heelstick (newborns)	None	The complete blood count (CBC) is often used as a broad screening test to determine an individual's general health status. It can be used to:\r\n\r\nScreen for a wide range of conditions and diseases\r\nHelp diagnose various conditions, such as anemia, infection, inflammation, bleeding disorder or leukemia, to name just a few\r\nMonitor the condition and/or effectiveness of treatment after a diagnosis is established\r\nMonitor treatment that is known to affect blood cells, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy	A health practitioner typically evaluates and interprets results from the components of the CBC together. Depending on the purpose of the test, a number of additional or follow-up tests may be ordered for further investigation.	Many different conditions can result in increases or decreases in blood cell populations. Some of these conditions may require treatment, while others may resolve on their own.\r\n\r\nRecent blood transfusions affect the results of the CBC.\r\n\r\nNormal CBC values for babies and children are different from adults. The laboratory will supply the reference ranges for various age groups, and a health practitioner will take these into consideration when interpreting data.

The test distinguishes between the types of bacteria that cause disease (pathogenic) and the types that are normally found in the digestive tract (normal flora). The test helps to determine if pathogenic bacteria are the cause of a person's gastrointestinal symptoms (gastroenteritis).\r\n\r\nThe bacteria found in stool are representative of the bacteria that are present in the digestive system (gastrointestinal tract). Certain bacteria and fungi called normal flora inhabit everyone's gastrointestinal tract. They play an important role in the digestion of food and their presence keeps a check on the growth of disease-causing bacteria.	To determine whether you have an infection of your digestive tract due to the presence of disease-causing (pathogenic) bacteria	When you have diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea and/or vomiting that is severe or lasts more than a few days	A fresh stool sample transported to the laboratory within 2 hours or one that has been placed in a transport medium (a collection vial containing a preservative)	None	A stool culture is used to detect the presence of disease-causing (pathogenic) bacteria and help diagnose an infection of the digestive system (gastrointestinal, GI tract). Since there are many causes of GI infections, a stool culture may be used in conjunction with other tests, such as a GI pathogens panel or an ova and parasite exam (O&P) to help establish a diagnosis.\r\n\r\nA GI pathogens panel is performed on a stool sample to simultaneously test for the viruses, bacteria, and parasites that are common causes of GI infections. These panels are relatively new and laboratories and healthcare practitioners are still determining how to utilize them to provide the optimum patient results while being cost-effective. A stool culture and an O&P may be done if a microbe is not identified by the panel and/or there is a suspicion of bacteria or parasites other than those included in the GI panel.\r\n\r\nMany GI infections in the U.S. resolve with no specific treatment, with only supportive care, and may not require testing. In otherwise healthy individuals, the infections are considered common illnesses that are not serious and sometimes thought of as "food poisoning" or \r\n"stomach flu." However, there are cases where it is useful to perform testing that identifies the cause of the GI infection – to guide its treatment, eliminate its source, and limit its spread.	If a stool culture is positive for pathogenic bacteria, then they are the most likely cause of the person's diarrhea and other symptoms. Results are frequently reported out with the name of the pathogenic bacteria that was detected.\r\n\r\nResults of stool cultures that are reported as negative usually reflect the fact that the stool culture was checked for the most common pathogens at several intervals and none were found (not isolated). A report may state: "no Campylobacter isolated," "no Salmonella or Shigella isolated," etc.\r\n\r\nIf the culture is negative for the major pathogens, then it is likely that the person's signs and symptoms are due to another cause or to a less common pathogen. It is also possible that pathogenic bacteria are present in the gastrointestinal tract, but there were too few bacteria in that particular stool sample to be detected. If a healthcare practitioner suspects that this is the case and symptoms continue, a stool culture on another sample may be ordered and/or followed up with other tests.\r\n\r\nMost diarrheal disease is caused by a single pathogen, but it is possible to have an infection with more than one.	Severe pathogenic bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract and those causing complications may be treated with antibiotics, but many uncomplicated cases are best left untreated. People with healthy immune systems will usually get better on their own within a week or so. They are instructed in how to prevent the spread of the infection and are treated and monitored for symptoms such as dehydration.\r\n\r\nPathogenic bacterial infections are monitored on a community and sometimes national level. Other than foreign travel-related cases, health officials try to determine where an infection came from so that they can address any potential public health concerns. Bacterial isolates causing foodborne illness are sent to the State Public Health Laboratories to be typed by molecular methods. The results of the typing are uploaded into a national database to detect common source outbreaks across the U.S. The typing helps to identify specific foods or food products that are the source of the infection.\r\n\r\nTravelers' diarrhea is typically caused by toxin-producing Escherichia coli, which are the leading cause of bacterial diarrhea infections among travelers to Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These strains of E. coli, however, are different than the strains of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (O157:H7), which can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome.
3	2018-12-19 09:07:20.815898+08	2018-12-19 09:07:20.815914+08	{}	t	Antinuclear Antibody (ANA)	antinuclear-antibody-ana	{ANA,"Fluorescent Antinuclear Antibody",FANA,"Antinuclear Antibody Screen"}	Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are a group of autoantibodies produced by a person's immune system when it fails to adequately distinguish between "self" and "nonself." The ANA test detects these autoantibodies in the blood.\r\n\r\nANA react with components of the body's own healthy cells and cause signs and symptoms such as tissue and organ inflammation, joint and muscle pain, and fatigue. ANA specifically target substances found in the nucleus of a cell, hence the name "antinuclear." They probably do not damage living cells because they cannot access their nuclei. However, ANA can cause damage to tissue by reacting with nuclear substances when they are released from injured or dying cells.\r\n\r\nThe ANA test is one of the primary tests for helping to diagnose a suspected autoimmune disorder or rule out other conditions with similar signs and symptoms. The ANA test may be positive with several autoimmune disorders. Patients with the autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are almost always positive for ANA, but the percentage of patients with other autoimmune disorders who have positive ANA results varies. Also, a significant number of patients with a variety of other types of disorders (and even some heathy people) may be positive for ANA, especially at low levels.	To detect and help diagnose certain autoimmune disorders, such as lupus and Sjögren syndrome, among other types	When a healthcare practitioner thinks that you have symptoms of certain autoimmune disorders	A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm	None; however, certain medications can affect ANA test results, so tell your healthcare provider about any prescription medications, nonprescription medications, or street drugs you use.	The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is used as a primary test to help evaluate a person for autoimmune disorders that affect many tissues and organs throughout the body (systemic) and is most often used as one of the tests to help diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, a positive ANA test by itself does not diagnose any one particular disease.\r\n\r\nDepending on a person's signs and symptoms and the suspected disorder, ANA testing may be followed by additional tests for specific autoantibodies. Some of these tests are considered subsets of the general ANA test and detect the presence of autoantibodies that target specific substances within cell nuclei, including anti-dsDNA, anti-centromere, anti-nucleolar, anti-histone and anti-RNA antibodies. An extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) panel (anti-RNP, anti-Sm, anti-SS-A, anti-SS-B, Scl-70, anti-Jo-1) may also be used in follow up to a positive ANA.\r\n\r\nThese supplemental tests are used in conjunction with a person's clinical history and physical examination findings to help diagnose or rule out autoimmune disorders, such as Sjögren syndrome, polymyositis and scleroderma.\r\n\r\nDifferent laboratories may use different test methods to detect ANA.\r\n\r\nIndirect fluorescent antibody (IFA)—this method is the traditional approach. A person's blood sample is mixed with cells that are affixed to a slide. Autoantibodies that may be present in the blood react with the cells. The slide is treated with a fluorescent antibody reagent and examined under a microscope. The presence (or absence) and pattern of fluorescence is noted.\r\nImmunoassays—laboratories may also use immunoassay to screen for ANA and may only use IFA to confirm positive results or results that are not clearly positive or negative. These methods are usually performed on automated instrumentation. They may be less sensitive than IFA in detecting ANA but may be more specific for autoimmune disorders.	A positive ANA test result means that autoantibodies are present. In a person with signs and symptoms, this suggests the presence of an autoimmune disease, but further evaluation is required to assist in making a final diagnosis. Again, some people without disease can have a positive ANA test.\r\n\r\nPositive ANA test results may be reported in different ways, depending on the test method.	ANA testing is not used to track or monitor the clinical course of lupus; thus, serial ANA tests for diagnosed patients are not commonly ordered once a diagnosis is established.\r\n\r\nSome infections, autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis as well as other conditions mentioned above can give a positive result for the ANA test.
4	2018-12-19 09:10:57.867234+08	2018-12-19 09:10:57.867251+08	{}	t	Partial Thromboplastin Time	partial-thromboplastin-time	{"Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time",aPTT,APTT}	The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is a screening test that helps evaluate a person's ability to appropriately form blood clots. It measures the number of seconds it takes for a clot to form in a person's sample of blood after substances (reagents) are added. The PTT assesses the amount and the function of certain proteins called coagulation factors that are an important part of blood clot formation.\r\n\r\nWhen body tissue(s) or blood vessel walls are injured, bleeding occurs and a process called hemostasis begins. Small cell fragments called platelets adhere to and then clump (aggregate) at the injury site. At the same time, a process called the coagulation cascade begins and coagulation factors are activated. Through the cascading reactions, threads called fibrin form and crosslink into a net that adheres to the injury site and stabilizes it. Along with the platelets adhering, this forms a stable blood clot to seal off injuries to blood vessels, prevents additional blood loss, and gives the damaged areas time to heal.\r\n\r\nEach component of this hemostatic process must function properly and be present in sufficient quantity for normal blood clot formation. If there is a deficiency in one or more of these factors, or if the factors function abnormally, then a stable clot may not form and bleeding continues.\r\n\r\nWith a PTT, a person's sample is compared to a normal reference interval for clotting time. When a person's PTT takes longer than normal to clot, the PTT is considered "prolonged." A prolonged PTT may be due to a condition that decreases or creates a dysfunction in one or more coagulation factors. Less often, it may be due to a condition in which the body produces certain antibodies directed against one or more coagulation factors, affecting their function.\r\n\r\nSometimes a PTT may be prolonged because the person tested produces an autoantibody called an antiphospholipid antibody that interferes with the test. This type of antibody affects the results of the test because it targets substances called phospholipids that are used in the PTT. Though antiphospholipid antibodies can prolong the PTT test result, in the body they are associated with excessive clotting. A person who produces these antibodies may be at an increased risk for a blood clot. A PTT maybe used as part of an evaluation of a person with signs and symptoms of excessive clotting or antiphospholipid syndrome. (See the article on Antiphospholipid Antibodies for additional details.)\r\n\r\nWhen a PTT is used to investigate bleeding or clotting episodes, it is often ordered along with a prothrombin time (PT). A health practitioner will evaluate the results of both tests to help determine the cause of bleeding or clotting episode(s).\r\n\r\nIt is now understood that coagulation tests such as the PT and PTT are based on what happens artificially in the test setting (in vitro) and thus do not necessarily reflect what actually happens in the body (in vivo). Nevertheless, they can be used to evaluate certain components of the hemostasis system. The PTT and PT tests each evaluate coagulation factors that are part of different groups of chemical reaction pathways in the cascade, called the intrinsic, extrinsic, and common pathways. (For more on this, see the article on the Coagulation Cascade.)	As part of an investigation of a possible bleeding disorder or blood clot (thrombotic episode); to monitor unfractionated (standard) heparin anticoagulant therapy; as part of screening before surgery or other invasive procedure	When you have unexplained bleeding, inappropriate blood clotting, or recurrent miscarriages; when you are on standard heparin anticoagulant therapy; sometimes as part of a pre-surgical screen	A blood sample drawn by needle from a vein in your arm	None	The PTT is used primarily to investigate unexplained bleeding or clotting. It may be ordered along with a prothrombin time (PT) test to evaluate hemostasis, the process that the body uses to form blood clots to help stop bleeding. These tests are usually the starting points for investigating excessive bleeding or clotting disorders.\r\n\r\nSeveral proteins called coagulation factors are involved in hemostasis and the formation of blood clots. When an injury occurs and bleeding begins, some coagulation factors are activated in a sequence of steps (coagulation cascade) that eventually help to form a clot. (See the "What is being tested?" section for more on this.)\r\n\r\nThe PTT is used to evaluate the coagulation factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II (prothrombin), and I (fibrinogen) as well as prekallikrein (PK) and high molecular weight kininogen (HK). A PT test evaluates the coagulation factors VII, X, V, II, and I (fibrinogen). By evaluating the results of the two tests together, a health practitioner can gain clues as to what bleeding or clotting disorder may be present. The PTT and PT are not diagnostic but usually provide information on whether further tests may be needed.\r\n\r\nSome examples of uses of a PTT include:\r\n\r\nTo identify coagulation factor deficiency; if the PTT is prolonged, further studies can then be performed to identify what coagulation factors may be deficient or dysfunctional, or to determine if an antibody to a coagulation factor (a specific inhibitor) is present in the blood.\r\nTo detect nonspecific autoantibodies, such as lupus anticoagulant; these are associated with clotting episodes and with recurrent miscarriages. For this reason, PTT testing may be performed as part of a clotting disorder panel to help investigate recurrent miscarriages or diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). A variation of the PTT called the LA-sensitive PTT may be used for this purpose.\r\nTo monitor standard (unfractionated, UF) heparin anticoagulant therapy; heparin is an anticoagulation drug that is given intravenously (IV) or by injection to prevent and to treat blood clots (embolism and thromboembolism). It prolongs PTT. When heparin is administered for therapeutic purposes, it must be closely monitored. If too much is given, the treated person may bleed excessively; with too little, the treated person may continue to clot.\r\nBased on carefully obtained patient histories, the PTT and PT tests are sometimes selectively performed as pre-surgical or before other invasive procedures to screen for potential bleeding tendencies.\r\nExamples of other testing that may be done along with a PTT or in follow up to abnormal results include:\r\n\r\nPlatelet count – should always be monitored during heparin therapy to promptly detect any heparin-induced thrombocytopenia\r\nThrombin time testing – sometimes ordered to help rule out heparin contamination\r\nFibrinogen testing – may be done to rule out a low level of fibrinogen as a cause of a prolonged PTT\r\nWhen an initial PTT is prolonged, a second PTT test is performed by mixing the person's plasma with pooled normal plasma (a collection of plasma from a number of normal donors). If the PTT time returns to normal ("corrects"), it suggests a deficiency of one or more of the coagulation factors in the person's plasma. If the time remains prolonged, then the problem may be due to the presence of an abnormal specific factor inhibitor (autoantibody) or nonspecific lupus anticoagulant.\r\nCoagulation factor tests – these measure the activity (function) of coagulation factors. They can detect reduced levels of the protein or proteins that don't work properly (have reduced function). Rarely, the antigen level (quantity) of a coagulation factor may also be measured.\r\nDilute Russell viper venom test (DRVVT) – a test that may be done if the presence of lupus anticoagulant is suspected (See the page on Lupus Anticoagulant Testing for more on this.)\r\nvon Willebrand factor – sometimes ordered to help determine if von Willebrand disease is the cause of a prolonged PTT	PTT results are typically reported in seconds. A PTT result that falls within a laboratory's reference interval usually indicates normal clotting function. However, mild to moderate deficiencies of a single coagulation factor may be present. The PTT may not be prolonged until the factor levels have decreased to 30% to 40% of normal. Also lupus anticoagulant may be present but may not prolong the PTT result. If the lupus anticoagulant (LA) is suspected, a more sensitive LA-sensitive PTT or a dilute Russell viper venom time (DRVVT) can be used to test for it.\r\n\r\nA prolonged PTT means that clotting is taking longer to occur than normal and may be due to a variety of causes. Often, this suggests that there may be a coagulation factor deficiency or a specific or nonspecific antibody (inhibitor) affecting the body's clotting ability. Coagulation factor deficiencies may be acquired or inherited.\r\n\r\n  Prolonged PTT tests may be due to:\r\n\r\nInherited factor deficiencies:\r\nvon Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder and it affects platelet function due to decreased von Willebrand factor.\r\nHemophilia A and hemophilia B (Christmas disease) are two other inherited bleeding disorders resulting from a decrease in factors VIII and IX, respectively.\r\nDeficiencies of other coagulation factors, like factors XII and XI\r\nAcquired factor deficiencies:\r\nAn example of an acquired deficiency is one due to lack of vitamin K. Vitamin K is essential for the formation of coagulation factors. Vitamin K deficiencies are rare but can occur due to an extremely poor diet, malabsorption disorders, or prolonged use of certain antibiotics, for example.\r\nMost coagulation factors are produced by the liver, thus liver disease may cause prolonged PT and PTT. With liver disease and vitamin K deficiency, PT is more likely to be prolonged than is PTT.\r\nA nonspecific inhibitor such as the lupus anticoagulant—the presence of these inhibitors is usually associated with inappropriate clotting (thrombosis), but can prolong the PTT. See the individual test articles for more on this.\r\nA specific inhibitor—although relatively rare, these are antibodies that specifically target certain coagulation factors, such as antibodies that target factor VIII. They may develop in someone with a bleeding disorder who is receiving factor replacements (such as factor VIII, which is used to treat hemophilia A) or spontaneously as an autoantibody. Factor-specific inhibitors can cause severe bleeding.\r\nHeparin—is an anticoagulant and will prolong a PTT, either as a contaminant of the sample or as part of anticoagulation therapy. For anticoagulant therapy, the target PTT is often about 1.5 to 2.5 times longer than a person's pretreatment level.\r\nWarfarin (Coumadin®) anticoagulation therapy—the PTT is not used to monitor warfarin therapy, but it may be affected by it. Typically, the PT is used to monitor warfarin therapy.\r\nOther anticoagulants—anticoagulation therapy with direct thrombin inhibitor (e.g., argatroban, dabigatran) or direct factor Xa inhibitor (e.g., rivaroxaban)\r\nProlonged PTT levels may also be seen with leukemia, excessive bleeding in pregnant women prior to or after giving birth, or recurrent miscarriages.\r\nResults of the PTT are often interpreted with that of the PT in determining what condition may be present.	Two anticoagulants often used, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and danaparoid, may not prolong the PTT and, if indicated, should be monitored using the heparin anti-factor Xa assay.\r\n\r\nSeveral factors can affect results of a PTT and the interpretation of test results:\r\n\r\nPeople with high hematocrit levels may have prolonged PTTs (in vitro artifact).\r\nHeparin contamination – this is the most common problem, especially when blood is collected from intravenous lines that are being kept "open" with heparin washes.\r\nDrugs such as antihistamines, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), aspirin, and chlorpromazine\r\nIn some cases, heparin can unintentionally decrease a person's platelet count in a complication called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. When this occurs, substitute anticoagulants such as a direct thrombin inhibitor (e.g., argatroban or bivalirudin) may be given. The PTT test is also used to monitor these therapies. It does not directly measure the anticoagulants used but measures their effect on blood clotting.

The A1c test evaluates the average amount of glucose in the blood over the last 2 to 3 months by measuring the percentage of glycated hemoglobin in the blood.\r\n\r\nHemoglobin is an oxygen-transporting protein found inside red blood cells (RBCs). There are several types of normal hemoglobin, but the predominant form – about 95-96% – is hemoglobin A. As glucose circulates in the blood, some of it spontaneously binds to hemoglobin A.\r\n\r\nThe higher the level of glucose in the blood, the more glycated hemoglobin is formed. Once the glucose binds to the hemoglobin, it remains there for the life of the red blood cell – normally about 120 days. The predominant form of glycated hemoglobin is referred to as A1c. A1c is produced on a daily basis and slowly cleared from the blood as older RBCs die and younger RBCs (with non-glycated hemoglobin) take their place.\r\n\r\nAn A1c test may be used to screen for and diagnose diabetes or risk of developing diabetes. Standards of medical care in diabetes from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) state that diabetes may be diagnosed based on A1c criteria or blood glucose criteria (e.g., the fasting blood glucose (FBG) or the 2-hour glucose tolerance test).\r\n\r\nA1c is also used to monitor treatment for individuals diagnosed with diabetes. It helps to evaluate how well your glucose levels have been controlled by treatment over time. For monitoring purposes, an A1c of less than 7% indicates good glucose control and a lower risk of diabetic complications for the majority of people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend that the management of glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes be more "patient-centered." It is recommend that people work closely with their healthcare practitioner to select a goal that reflects each person's individual health status and that balances risks and benefits.	To help determine whether you are at an increased risk of developing diabetes; to help diagnose diabetes and prediabetes; to monitor diabetes and to aid in treatment decisions	As part of a health checkup or when you have risk factors for or symptoms of diabetes; after first diagnosis with diabetes, every 3-4 months or about 120 days to ensure that your glycemic goals are met and/or maintained or when your therapy plan has changed	A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein or a drop of blood is taken from a finger by pricking it with a small, pointed lancet.	None	Screening and diagnosis\r\n\r\nThe hemoglobin A1c test may be used to screen for and diagnose diabetes and prediabetes in adults. \r\n\r\nThe A1c test, however, should not be used for:\r\n\r\nScreening for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes \r\nDiagnosis of gestational diabetes in pregnant women \r\nDiagnosis of diabetes in children and teens \r\nPeople who have had recent severe bleeding or blood transfusions \r\nPeople with chronic kidney disease or liver disease \r\nPeople with blood disorders such as iron-deficiency anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency anemia\r\nIndividuals with some hemoglobin variants (e.g., sickle cell disease or thalassemia)\r\n \r\nIn these cases, a fasting plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance test or fructosamine test should be used for screening or diagnosing diabetes.\r\n\r\nOnly A1c tests that have been referenced to an accepted laboratory method (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program certified) should be used for diagnostic or screening purposes. Currently, point-of-care tests, such as those that may be used at a healthcare practitioner's office or a patient's bedside, are not accurate enough for use in diagnosis but can be used to monitor treatment (lifestyle and drug therapies).\r\n\r\nMonitoring\r\n\r\nThe A1c test is also used to monitor the glucose control of people with diabetes over time. The goal of those with diabetes is to keep their blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. This helps to minimize the complications caused by chronically elevated glucose levels, such as progressive damage to body organs like the kidneys, eyes, cardiovascular system, and nerves. Unlike glucose results, which provide information about the glycemic status of a person strictly for the time of blood collection, the A1c test result gives a picture of the average amount of glucose in the blood over the last 2-3 months. This can help people with diabetes and their healthcare practitioners know if the measures that are being taken to control their diabetes are successful or need to be adjusted.\r\n\r\nA1c is frequently used to people help newly diagnosed with diabetes determine how elevated their uncontrolled blood glucose levels have been over the last 2-3 months. The test is ordered several times until an optimal glucose level is achieved.	In screening and diagnosis, some results that may be seen include:\r\n\r\nA person who does not have diabetes: A1c result less than 5.7% (39 mmol/mol)\r\nDiabetes: A1c level is 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) or higher\r\nIncreased risk of developing diabetes in the future (pre-diabetes): A1c of 5.7% to 6.4% (39-46 mmol/mol)\r\n \r\nFor monitoring glucose control, A1c is currently reported as a percentage and, for most people with diabetes, it is recommended that they aim to keep their hemoglobin A1c below 7%. The closer they can keep their A1c to the American Diabetes Association (ADA)'s therapeutic goal of less than 7% without experiencing excessive low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), the better their diabetes is in control. As the A1c increases, so does the risk of complications.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you have type 2 diabetes, you may select an A1c goal in consultation with your healthcare practitioner. The goal may depend on several factors, such as length of time since diagnosis, the presence of other diseases as well as diabetes complications (e.g., vision impairment or loss, kidney damage), risk of complications from hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, and whether or not the person has a support system and healthcare resources readily available.\r\n\r\nFor example, a person with heart disease who has lived with type 2 diabetes for many years without diabetic complications may have a higher A1c target (e.g., 7.5%-8.0%) set by their healthcare practitioner, while someone who is otherwise healthy and just diagnosed may have a lower target (e.g., 6.0%-6.5%) as long as low blood sugar is not a significant risk.\r\n\r\nThe A1c test report also may include the result expressed in SI units (mmol/mol) and an estimated Average Glucose (eAG), which is a calculated result based on the hemoglobin A1c levels. The estimated Average Glucose (eAG) reflects indirectly the glucose level over a period of 2-3 months before the A1c measurement.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of reporting eAG is to help a person relate A1c results to everyday glucose monitoring levels and to laboratory glucose tests. The formula for eAG converts percentage A1c to units of mg/dL or mmol/L. (For details, see below.)\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the eAG is still an evaluation of a person's glucose over the last couple of months. It will not match up exactly to any one daily glucose test result. The ADA has adopted this calculation and provides a calculator and information on the eAG on their DiabetesPro web site. The NGSP web site also provides a calculator to convert hemoglobin A1c in SI units mmol/mol into percentage.	None

Laboratory tests detect the presence and measure the quantity of specific thyroid autoantibodies in the blood.\r\n\r\nThe thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland that lies flat against the windpipe in the throat. The primary hormones that it produces, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are vital in helping to regulate the rate at which the body uses energy (metabolism). The body uses a feedback system in which thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulates the thyroid to produce T4 and T3 as needed. This system helps maintain a relatively stable amount of the thyroid hormones in the blood. When thyroid antibodies interfere with this process, they can lead to chronic conditions and autoimmune disorders associated with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, such as Graves disease or Hashimoto thyroiditis.	To help diagnose and monitor autoimmune thyroid diseases and to distinguish these from other forms of thyroid disease; to help guide treatment decisions	When you have an enlarged thyroid (goiter) and/or when your other thyroid tests, such as total or free T3, free T4, and TSH, indicate thyroid dysfunction; along with a thyroglobulin test when your healthcare provider is using it as a monitoring tool; at intervals recommended by your healthcare provider when you have a known autoimmune thyroid disorder	A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm	None	Testing for thyroid antibodies, such as thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO), is primarily ordered to help diagnose an autoimmune thyroid disease and to distinguish it from other forms of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid autoantibodies develop when a person's immune system mistakenly targets components of the thyroid gland or thyroid proteins, leading to chronic inflammation of the thyroid (thyroiditis), tissue damage, and/or disruption of thyroid function. (Read more in the "What is being tested?" section.)\r\n\r\nOne or more of the following tests may be performed to help establish a diagnosis of and/or monitor an autoimmune thyroid disorder:\r\n\r\nThyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO)—the most common test for autoimmune thyroid disease; it can be detected in Graves disease or Hashimoto thyroiditis.\r\nThyroglobulin antibody (TGAb)— this antibody targets thyroglobulin, the storage form of thyroid hormones.\r\nThyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TSHRAb)—includes two types of autoantibodies that attach to proteins in the thyroid to which TSH normally binds (TSH receptors):\r\nThyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) binds to receptors and promotes the production of thyroid hormones, leading to hyperthyroidism.\r\nThyroid binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) blocks TSH from binding to receptors, blocking production of thyroid hormones and resulting in hypothyroidism.\r\n \r\nTBII is not routinely tested, but TSI is often used to help diagnose Graves disease.\r\n\r\nThese tests may be ordered to help investigate the cause of an enlarged thyroid (goiter) or other signs and symptoms associated with low or high thyroid hormone levels. Testing may be performed as a follow-up when other thyroid test results such as total or free T3, free T4, and/or TSH indicate thyroid dysfunction.\r\n\r\nOne or more thyroid antibody tests may also be ordered to determine if a person with an autoimmune condition is at risk of developing thyroid dysfunction. This may occur with disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or pernicious anemia.\r\n\r\nA person who is receiving treatment for thyroid cancer may be monitored with a thyroglobulin test. In this case, the thyroglobulin antibody test is used to determine if the antibody is present in the person's blood and likely to interfere with the test to measure the thyroglobulin level.	Negative test results means that thyroid autoantibodies are not present in the blood at the time of testing and may indicate that symptoms are due to a cause other than autoimmune. However, a certain percentage of people who have autoimmune thyroid disease do not have autoantibodies. If it is suspected that the autoantibodies may develop over time, as may happen with some autoimmune disorders, then repeat testing may be done at a later date.\r\n\r\nMild to moderately elevated levels of thyroid antibodies may be found in a variety of thyroid and autoimmune disorders, such as thyroid cancer, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, pernicious anemia, and autoimmune collagen vascular diseases.\r\n\r\nSignificantly increased concentrations most frequently indicate thyroid autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves disease.\r\n\r\nIn general, the presence of thyroid antibodies suggests the presence of an autoimmune thyroid disorder and the higher the level, the more likely that is. Levels of autoantibody that rise over time may be more significant than stable levels as they may indicate an increase in autoimmune disease activity. All of these antibodies, if present in a pregnant woman, can increase the risk of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism in the developing baby or newborn.\r\n\r\nIf a person with thyroid cancer has thyroglobulin antibodies, they may interfere with tests for thyroglobulin levels. This may mean that the thyroglobulin test cannot be used as a tumor marker or to monitor the individual's thyroid cancer. Some methods of testing, including one called mass spectrometry, are not affected by the presence of thyroglobulin antibodies. When measured these ways, the thyroglobulin test can be used as a tumor marker, regardless of whether or not thyroglobulin antibodies are present. However, if a method is used that is affected by thyroglobulin antibodies, then the levels of the antibodies themselves can be used as a tumor marker to monitor thyroid cancer. If they stay high or drop low initially but increase over time, then it is likely that the treatment has not been effective and the cancer is continuing or recurring. If levels are falling and/or have fallen to low or undetectable levels, then it is more likely that the therapy has been effective in eradicating the cancer.\r\n\r\nA certain percentage of people who are healthy may be positive for one or more thyroid antibodies. The prevalence of these antibodies tends to be higher in women, tends to increase with age, and for thyroid peroxidase antibodies, indicates an increased risk of developing thyroid disease in the future. If an individual with no apparent thyroid dysfunction has a thyroid antibody, the healthcare provider will track the person's health over time. While most may never experience thyroid dysfunction, a few may develop it.	The sensitivity and specificity of thyroid antibody testing is improving but is still not as good as health practitioners would like it to be. All of the thyroid antibody tests have changed over time. This is part of the reason that the tests have historically acquired many different names. There are also many distinct methodologies and each has different reference (normal) ranges. If someone is having several tests done at regular intervals for monitoring purposes, it is best to have test done by the same laboratory each time, using the same methodology.

The test actually measures the rate of fall (sedimentation) of erythrocytes (red blood cells) in a sample of blood that has been placed into a tall, thin, vertical tube. Results are reported as the millimeters of clear fluid (plasma) that are present at the top portion of the tube after one hour.\r\n\r\nWhen a sample of blood is placed in a tube, the red blood cells normally settle out relatively slowly, leaving little clear plasma. The red cells settle at a faster rate in the presence of an increased level of proteins, particularly proteins called acute phase reactants. The level of acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen increases in the blood in response to inflammation.\r\n\r\nInflammation is part of the body's immune response. It can be acute, developing rapidly after trauma, injury or infection, for example, or can occur over an extended time (chronic) with conditions such as autoimmune diseases or cancer.\r\n\r\nThe ESR is not diagnostic; it is a non-specific test that may be elevated in a number of these different conditions. It provides general information about the presence or absence of an inflammatory condition.\r\n\r\nThere have been questions about the usefulness of the ESR in light of newer tests that have come into use that are more specific. However, ESR test is typically indicated for the diagnosis and monitoring of temporal arteritis, systemic vasculitis and polymyalgia rheumatica. Extremely elevated ESR is useful in developing a rheumatic disease differential diagnosis. In addition, ESR may still be a good option in some situations, when, for example, the newer tests are not available in areas with limited resources or when monitoring the course of a disease.	To detect the presence of inflammation caused by one or more conditions such as infections, tumors or autoimmune diseases; to help diagnose and monitor specific conditions such as temporal arteritis, systemic vasculitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, or rheumatoid arthritis	When your health practitioner thinks that you might have a condition causing inflammation; when you have signs and symptoms associated with temporal arteritis, systemic vasculitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, or rheumatoid arthritis such as headaches, neck or shoulder pain, pelvic pain, anemia, poor appetite, unexplained weight loss, and joint stiffness	A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm	None	The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate) is a relatively simple, inexpensive, non-specific test that has been used for many years to help detect inflammation associated with conditions such as infections, cancers, and autoimmune diseases.\r\n\r\nESR is said to be a non-specific test because an elevated result often indicates the presence of inflammation but does not tell the health practitioner exactly where the inflammation is in the body or what is causing it. An ESR can be affected by other conditions besides inflammation. For this reason, the ESR is typically used in conjunction with other tests, such as C-reactive protein.\r\n\r\nESR is used to help diagnose certain specific inflammatory diseases, including temporal arteritis, systemic vasculitis and polymyalgia rheumatica. (For more on these, read the article on Vasculitis.) A significantly elevated ESR is one of the main test results used to support the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThis test may also be used to monitor disease activity and response to therapy in both of the above diseases as well as some others, such as lupus.	The result of an ESR is reported as the millimeters of clear fluid (plasma) that are present at the top portion of the tube after one hour (mm/hr).\r\n\r\nSince ESR is a non-specific marker of inflammation and is affected by other factors, the results must be used along with other clinical findings, the individual's health history, and results from other laboratory tests. If the ESR and clinical findings match, the health practitioner may be able to confirm or rule out a suspected diagnosis.\r\n\r\nA single elevated ESR, without any symptoms of a specific disease, will usually not give enough information to make a medical decision. Furthermore, a normal result does not rule out inflammation or disease.\r\n\r\nModerately elevated ESR occurs with inflammation but also with anemia, infection, pregnancy, and with aging.\r\n\r\nA very high ESR usually has an obvious cause, such as a severe infection, marked by an increase in globulins, polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis. A health practitioner will typically use other follow-up tests, such as blood cultures, depending on the person's symptoms. People with multiple myeloma or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (tumors that make large amounts of immunoglobulins) typically have very high ESRs even if they don't have inflammation.\r\n\r\nWhen monitoring a condition over time, rising ESRs may indicate increasing inflammation or a poor response to a therapy; normal or decreasing ESRs may indicate an appropriate response to treatment.

Influenza testing detects the presence of the virus in a sample of respiratory secretions.\r\n\r\nInfluenza tends to be seasonal, usually beginning in late fall and disappearing in early spring. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), influenza affects millions of Americans each season. Signs and symptoms like headache, fever, chills, muscle pains, exhaustion, a stuffy nose, sore throat, and a cough tend to be more severe and longer lasting than the symptoms caused by the common cold.\r\n\r\nTwo types of influenza virus, A and B, cause annual flu pandemics and most epidemics. Type C can cause mild respiratory illness and is not thought to cause epidemics. There are numerous subtypes of influenza A viruses, and they are named using two designations based on the antigenic components of the virus, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The most common influenza A viruses currently infecting humans have the subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. (For more on this, see the condition article on Influenza.)\r\n\r\nIt is common for healthcare practitioners to diagnose and treat the flu without laboratory testing, especially during peak influenza season and when influenza has already been documented in an area. However, influenza testing can help rule out other illnesses and reduce the chances of people using unnecessary antibiotics, while increasing the chances that they will receive anti-viral therapy early in the illness, when it is most effective.\r\n\r\nAlso, if there is an outbreak of respiratory illness in a confined setting like a hospital, nursing home, or school, diagnostic testing will help determine the cause of the outbreak. Influenza testing also helps local and state health departments and the CDC track influenza in communities. Since the flu virus changes every year, testing also helps the CDC to monitor the subtypes and strains of flu that are circulating that year, to collect information for developing flu vaccines, and to monitor strains for resistance to anti-viral drugs.\r\n\r\nThere are several different kinds of influenza tests and they serve different purposes. Read the "How is it used?" section to learn more.	To determine whether or not you have an influenza infection (flu), especially if you are hospitalized, have a weakened immune system, or are otherwise at an increased risk of serious complications from influenza; to help your healthcare practitioner make treatment decisions; to help determine whether or not the flu has spread to your community	When it is flu season and a healthcare practitioner wants to determine whether your symptoms are due to seasonal influenza A or B or to another cause; within 3 to 4 days of the onset of signs and symptoms, such as fever, headache, muscle aches, sore throat, weakness, fatigue, cough, sore throat, stuffy nose and sometimes runny nose	Depending on the test used, a respiratory sample collected on a swab from the nasopharynx or a nasal aspirate; sometimes, a nasal or throat swab	None	Influenza testing may be used to help diagnose an influenza infection (flu) and help make treatment decisions. Sometimes influenza testing is used to help document the presence of influenza in the community or to help determine whether an outbreak of flu is occurring, especially in settings such as nursing homes and schools. Testing may be used to identify the type and/or the strain of influenza causing infections. Photo source: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\r\n\r\nNot all cases of influenza require testing for antiviral treatments to be prescribed. Healthcare practitioners may diagnose and treat influenza without testing if the person has typical signs and symptoms of the flu, plus it is the flu season and it is known that the flu has reached a community. If it is outside the 3 to 4 day window when antiviral treatment is most effective and there is no evidence of severe illness or secondary complications, the person may simply be sent home to rest, drink fluids, and soothe symptoms with over-the-counter remedies.\r\n\r\nHowever, the flu can be deadly. Testing can help healthcare practitioners minimize its spread and prescribe antiviral drugs to treat patients to lessen its severity, if it is diagnosed early. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing in certain situations:\r\n\r\nFor patients in the hospital, or with high-risk conditions, who are suspected of having the flu\r\nFor cases in which an influenza diagnosis will guide care or affect actions taken to control the spread of the virus to others in close contact and/or in the community\r\nFor people who had severe symptoms and died from a suspected case of influenza\r\nTesting is also performed to look for new strains of viruses to help prevent possible pandemics, to monitor for antiviral resistance, and prepare for the next year's flu vaccine.	A positive flu test means that the affected person most likely has influenza A or B, and treatment with antiviral medication may be prescribed to minimize symptoms. However, it may not tell the healthcare practitioner which strain of influenza is causing the infection, how severe the symptoms are likely to be, or whether or not a person may experience any secondary complications.\r\n\r\nA negative influenza test may mean that the person has something other than influenza, that the test is not detecting the influenza strain, or that there is not sufficient virus in the specimen to allow it to be detected. This may be due to either a poor specimen collection or because a person has had the flu for several days and less virus is being shed. New strains of influenza may be present that diagnostic tests cannot reliably detect.\r\n\r\nSome rapid tests can further identify the subtypes of influenza A, such as H1N1, and some identify other respiratory viruses, such as RSV.\r\n\r\nViral cultures, if positive, identify the virus present. If the virus present is influenza, further tests can be performed to determine which strain is present and its susceptibility to antiviral agents.	Treated or untreated, most influenza infections will go away within one or two weeks, although fatigue and a cough may last a while longer. A few people, however, may develop serious secondary complications. These complications often arise just as influenza symptoms are fading.\r\n\r\nAnyone is susceptible to complications from the flu, but the very young, the elderly, and people who are immunocompromised or who have pre-existing lung disease are most affected. Complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, and encephalitis can be very serious and may require immediate medical treatment.

A lipid panel measures the level of specific lipids in the blood.\r\n\r\nTwo important lipids, cholesterol and triglycerides, are transported in the blood by lipoprotein particles. Each particle contains a combination of protein, cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid molecules. The particles measured with a lipid profile are classified by their density into high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).\r\n\r\nMonitoring and maintaining healthy levels of these lipids is important in staying healthy. While the body produces the cholesterol needed to function properly, the source for some cholesterol is the diet. Eating too much of foods that are high in saturated fats and trans unsaturated fats (trans fats) or having an inherited predisposition can result in a high level of cholesterol in the blood. The extra cholesterol may be deposited in plaques on the walls of blood vessels. Plaques can narrow or eventually block the opening of blood vessels, leading to hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and increasing the risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease and stroke. A high level of triglycerides in the blood is also associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), although the reason for this is not well understood.\r\n\r\nA lipid panel typically includes:\r\n\r\nTotal cholesterol\r\nHigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) — often called "good cholesterol" because it removes excess cholesterol and carries it to the liver for removal.\r\nLow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) — often called "bad cholesterol" because it deposits excess cholesterol in walls of blood vessels, which can contribute to atherosclerosis.\r\nTriglycerides	To assess your risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD); to monitor treatment	Screening when no risk factors present: for adults, every four to six years; for youths, once between the ages of 9 and 11 and again between ages 17 and 21\r\n\r\nMonitoring: at regular intervals when risk factors are present, when prior results showed high risk levels, and/or to monitor effectiveness of treatment	A blood sample obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in your arm or from a fingerstick	Typically, fasting for 9-12 hours (water only) before having your blood drawn is required, but some labs offer non-fasting lipid testing.

The lipid panel is used as part of a cardiac risk assessment to help determine an individual's risk of heart disease and to help make decisions about what treatment may be best if there is borderline or high risk.\r\n\r\nLipids are a group of fats and fat-like substances that are important constituents of cells and sources of energy.

(For more on lipids, see the "What is being tested?" section.)\r\n\r\nThe results of the lipid panel are considered along with other known risk factors of heart disease to develop a plan of treatment and follow-up. Depending on the results and other risk factors, treatment options may involve lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise or lipid-lowering medications such as statins.\r\n\r\nA lipid panel typically includes:\r\n\r\nTotal cholesterol — this test measures all of the cholesterol in all the lipoprotein particles.\r\nHigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) — measures the cholesterol in HDL particles; often called "good cholesterol" because it removes excess cholesterol and carries it to the liver for removal.\r\nLow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) — calculates the cholesterol in LDL particles; often called "bad cholesterol" because it deposits excess cholesterol in walls of blood vessels, which can contribute to atherosclerosis. Usually, the amount of LDL-C is calculated using the results of total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglycerides.\r\nTriglycerides — measures all the triglycerides in all the lipoprotein particles; most is in the very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).\r\nSome other information may be reported as part of the lipid panel. These parameters are calculated from the results of the tests identified above.\r\n\r\nVery low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) — calculated from triglycerides/5; this formula is based on the typical composition of VLDL particles.\r\nNon-HDL-C — calculated from total cholesterol minus HDL-C.\r\nCholesterol/HDL ratio — calculated ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-C.\r\nAn extended profile (or advanced lipid testing) may also include low-density lipoprotein particle number/concentration (LDL-P). This test measures the number of LDL particles, rather than measuring the amount of LDL-cholesterol. It is thought that this value may more accurately reflect heart disease risk in certain people. (For more, see the article on LDL Particle Testing.	In general, healthy lipid levels help to maintain a healthy heart and lower the risk of heart attack or stroke. A health practitioner will take into consideration the results of each component of a lipid panel plus other risk factors to help determine a person's overall risk of coronary heart disease, whether treatment is necessary and, if so, which treatment will best help to lower the person's risk of heart disease.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III provided the guidelines for evaluating lipid levels and determining treatment. However, in 2013, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published new guidelines on treatment of cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in adults. These guidelines recommend a treatment strategy different than those from NCEP. Decisions about cholesterol-lowering therapies are no longer focused on LDL-C or non-HDL-C targets, but are based on the 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and other factors.\r\n\r\nThe latest guidelines include a newly developed, evidence-based risk calculator for ASCVD used to identify individuals most likely to benefit from therapy. It is intended for people without heart disease between the ages of 40 and 79. Many factors are considered in the calculation, including age, gender, race, total cholesterol, HDL-C, blood pressure, presence of diabetes, and smoking habit. Additionally, the updated guidelines recommend evaluating therapeutic response compared to LDL-C baseline values, with reduction thresholds differing based on the intensity of the lipid-lowering drug therapy.	There is increasing interest in measuring triglycerides in people who have not fasted. The reason is that a non-fasting sample may be more representative of the "usual" circulating level of triglyceride since most of the day, blood lipid levels reflect post-meal (post-prandial) levels rather than fasting levels. However, it is not yet certain how to interpret non-fasting levels for evaluating risk, so at present there is no change in the current recommendations for fasting prior to tests for lipid levels.\r\n\r\nA routine cardiac risk assessment typically includes a fasting lipid panel. Beyond that, research continues into the usefulness of other non-traditional markers of cardiac risk, such as Lp-PLA2. A health practitioner may choose to evaluate one or more of these markers to help determine someone's risk, but there is no consensus on their use and they are not widely available. For a more detailed discussion on these, see the article on Cardiac Risk Assessment.

The liver is one of the largest organs in the body and is located in the upper right-hand part of the abdomen and behind the lower ribs. The liver metabolizes and detoxifies drugs and substances that are harmful to the body. It produces blood clotting factors, proteins, and enzymes, helps maintain hormone balances, and stores vitamins and minerals. Bile, a fluid produced by the liver, is transported through ducts directly to the small intestine to help digest fats or to the gallbladder to be stored and concentrated for later use.\r\n\r\nA variety of diseases and infections can cause acute or chronic damage to the liver, causing inflammation (hepatitis), scarring (cirrhosis), bile duct obstructions, liver tumors, and liver dysfunction. Alcohol, drugs, some herbal supplements, and toxins can also pose a threat. A significant amount of liver damage may be present before symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools, itching (pruritus), nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and unexplained weight loss or gain emerge. Early detection is essential in order to minimize damage and preserve liver function.\r\n\r\nThe liver panel measures enzymes, proteins, and substances that are produced, processed or eliminated by the liver and are affected by liver injury. Some are released by damaged liver cells and some reflect a decrease in the liver's ability to perform one or more of its functions. When performed together, these tests give a healthcare practitioner a snapshot of the health of a person's liver, an indication of the potential severity of any liver injury, change in liver status over time, and a starting place for further diagnostic testing.	To screen for, detect, evaluate, and monitor acute and chronic liver inflammation (hepatitis), liver infection, liver disease and/or and damage	Periodically to evaluate liver function; whenever you are at risk for liver injury; when you are taking medications that may affect your liver; when you have a liver disease; when you have symptoms associated with liver damage, such as jaundice	A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm; for infants, blood may be drawn by puncturing the heel with a lancet.	You may be instructed to fast overnight with only water permitted. Follow any instructions you are given. Inform the healthcare practitioner about all prescription and over-the-counter medications, herbal medications, vitamins and supplements you are taking.	A liver panel may be used to screen for liver damage, especially if someone has a condition or is taking a drug that may affect the liver. A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), which is often performed as part of a general health checkup, may be ordered instead of a liver panel for routine screening. This group of tests includes most of the liver panel as well as additional tests that evaluate other organs and systems within the body.\r\n\r\nA liver panel or one or more of its component tests may be used to help diagnose liver disease if a person has signs and symptoms that indicate possible liver dysfunction. If a person has a known condition or liver disease, testing may be performed at intervals to monitor the health of the liver and to evaluate the effectiveness of any treatments. A series of bilirubin tests, for instance, may be ordered to evaluate and monitor a jaundiced newborn.\r\n\r\nAbnormal tests on a liver panel may prompt a repeat analysis of one or more tests, or of the whole panel, to see if the elevations or decreases persist and/or may indicate the need for additional testing to determine the cause of the liver dysfunction.\r\n\r\nThe panel usually consists of several tests that are run at the same time on a blood sample. These typically include:\r\n\r\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) – an enzyme mainly found in the liver; the best test for detecting hepatitis\r\nAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) – an enzyme related to the bile ducts but also produced by the bones, intestines, and during pregnancy by the placenta (afterbirth); often increased when bile ducts are blocked.\r\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) – an enzyme found in the liver and a few other organs, particularly the heart and other muscles in the body\r\nBilirubin – two different tests of bilirubin often used together (especially if a person has jaundice): total bilirubin measures all the bilirubin in the blood; direct bilirubin measures a form that is conjugated (combined with another compound) in the liver.\r\nAlbumin – measures the main protein made by the liver; the level can be affected by liver and kidney function and by decreased production or increased loss.\r\nTotal protein (TP) – measures albumin and all other proteins in blood, including antibodies made to help fight off infections\r\nDepending on the healthcare provider and the laboratory, other tests that may be included in a liver panel are:\r\n\r\nGamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) – another enzyme found mainly in liver cells\r\nLactate dehydrogenase (LD) – an enzyme released with cell damage; found in cells throughout the body\r\nProthrombin time (PT) – the liver produces proteins involved in the clotting (coagulation) of blood; the PT measures clotting function and, if abnormal, may indicate liver damage.\r\nAlpha-feto protein (AFP) – associated with regeneration or proliferation of liver cell\r\nAutoimmune antibodies (e.g., ANA, SMA, anti-LKM-1) – associated with autoimmune hepatitis	Liver panel test results are not diagnostic of a specific condition; they indicate that there may be a problem with the liver. In a person who does not have symptoms or identifiable risk factors, abnormal liver test results may indicate a temporary liver injury or reflect something that is happening elsewhere in the body – such as in the skeletal muscles, pancreas, or heart. It may also indicate early liver disease and the need for further testing and/or periodic monitoring.\r\n\r\nResults of liver panels are usually evaluated together. Several sets of results from tests performed over a few days or weeks are often assessed together to determine if a pattern is present. Each person will have a unique set of test results that will typically change over time. A healthcare practitioner evaluates the combination of liver test results to gain clues about the underlying condition. Often, further testing is necessary to determine what is causing the liver damage and/or disease.\r\n\r\nIf a person is taking drugs that may affect their liver, then abnormal test results may indicate a need to reevaluate the dosage or choice of medication. When a person with liver disease is being monitored, then the healthcare practitioner will evaluate the results of the liver panel together to determine if liver function or damage is worsening or improving. For example, increasingly abnormal bilirubin, albumin, and/or PT may indicate a deterioration in liver function, while stable or improving results of these tests may indicate liver function preservation or improvement.	In order to diagnose a liver disease, a healthcare practitioner will evaluate the liver panel test results, order follow-up tests such as hepatitis virus testing, and may order a liver biopsy and/or imaging scans to help confirm a diagnosis and determine the extent of liver damage.

The tests detect and/or measure several substances in the urine, such as byproducts of normal and abnormal metabolism, cells, cellular fragments, and bacteria.\r\n\r\nUrine is produced by the kidneys, two fist-sized organs located on either side of the spine at the bottom of the ribcage. The kidneys filter wastes out of the blood, help regulate the amount of water in the body, and conserve proteins, electrolytes, and other compounds that the body can reuse. Anything that is not needed is eliminated in the urine, traveling from the kidneys through ureters to the bladder and then through the urethra and out of the body. Urine is generally yellow and relatively clear, but each time a person urinates, the color, quantity, concentration, and content of the urine will be slightly different because of varying constituents.\r\n\r\nMany disorders may be detected in their early stages by identifying substances that are not normally present in the urine and/or by measuring abnormal levels of certain substances. Some examples include glucose, protein, bilirubin, red blood cells, white blood cells, crystals, and bacteria. They may be present because:\r\n\r\nThere is an elevated level of the substance in the blood and the body responds by trying to eliminate the excess in the urine.\r\nKidney disease is present.\r\nThere is a urinary tract infection present, as in the case of bacteria and white blood cells.\r\nA complete urinalysis consists of three distinct testing phases:\r\n\r\nVisual examination, which evaluates the urine's color and clarity\r\nChemical examination, which tests chemically for about 9 substances that provide valuable information about health and disease and determines the concentration of the urine\r\nMicroscopic examination, which identifies and counts the type of cells, casts, crystals, and other components such as bacteria and mucus that can be present in urine\r\nSee below for details on each of these examinations.\r\n\r\nA microscopic examination is typically performed when there is an abnormal finding on the visual or chemical examination, or if a healthcare practitioner specifically orders it.\r\n\r\nAbnormal findings on a urinalysis may prompt repeat testing to see if the results are still abnormal and/or may be followed by additional urine and blood tests to help establish a diagnosis.	To screen for, help diagnose and/or monitor several diseases and conditions, such as kidney disorders or urinary tract infections (UTIs)	When you have symptoms, such as abdominal pain, back pain, frequent or painful urination; sometimes as part of a health examination, pregnancy check-up, hospital admission, or pre-surgical work-up	One to two ounces of urine—a sufficient sample is required for accurate results; sometimes you may be directed to collect a sample using a "clean-catch" technique: women should spread the labia of the vagina and clean from front to back; men should wipe the tip of the penis. Start to urinate, let some urine fall into the toilet, then collect one to two ounces of urine in the container provided, then void the rest into the toilet.	None	The urinalysis is a set of screening tests that can detect some common diseases. It may be used to screen for and/or help diagnose conditions such as a urinary tract infections, kidney disorders, liver problems, diabetes or other metabolic conditions, to name a few.\r\n\r\nA urinalysis is comprised of several chemical, microscopic and visual examinations used to detect cells, cell fragments and substances such as crystals or casts in the urine associated with the various conditions listed above. It can detect abnormalities that might require follow-up investigation and additional testing. Often, substances such as protein or glucose will begin to appear in the urine before people are aware that they may have a problem.\r\n\r\nIn people diagnosed with diseases or conditions, such as kidney disease or diabetes, the urinalysis may be used in conjunction with other tests, such as urine albumin, to follow treatment.	Urinalysis results can have many interpretations. Abnormal findings are a warning that something may be wrong and should be evaluated further. A healthcare practitioner must correlate the urinalysis results with a person's symptoms and clinical findings and search for the causes of abnormal findings with other targeted tests, such as a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), renal panel, liver panel, or urine culture (for urinary tract infection).\r\n\r\nGenerally, the greater the concentration of the atypical substance, such as greatly increased amounts of glucose, protein, or red blood cells, the more likely it is that there is a problem that needs to be addressed. However, the results do not tell the healthcare practitioner exactly what the cause of the finding is or whether it is a temporary or chronic condition.\r\n\r\nA normal urinalysis does not guarantee that there is no illness. Some people will not release elevated amounts of a substance early in a disease process, and some will release them sporadically during the day, which means that they may be missed by a single urine sample. In very dilute urine, small quantities of chemicals may be undetectable.	There are many factors that can affect or interfere with the tests that comprise a urinalysis. If instructed to do so, it is important to follow the directions carefully for a "clean-catch" sample. Give a complete history to your healthcare practitioner, including any prescribed or over-the-counter medications or supplements you may be taking. If you are a women, be sure to tell your healthcare practitioner whether you are menstruating.

Infections of the bloodstream are most commonly caused by bacteria (bacteremia) but can also be caused by yeasts or other fungi (fungemia) or by a virus (viremia). Although blood can be used to test for viruses, this article focuses on the use of blood cultures to detect and identify bacteria and fungi in the blood.\r\n\r\nA blood infection typically originates from some other specific site within the body, spreading from that site when a person has a severe infection and/or the immune system cannot confine it to its source. For example, a urinary tract infection may spread from the bladder and/or kidneys into the blood and then be carried throughout the body, infecting other organs and causing a serious and sometimes life-threatening systemic infection. The terms septicemia and sepsis are sometimes used interchangeably to describe this condition. Septicemia refers to an infection of the blood while sepsis is the body's serious, overwhelming, and sometimes life-threatening response to infection. This condition often requires prompt and aggressive treatment, usually in an intensive care unit of a hospital.\r\n\r\nOther serious complications can result from an infection of the blood. Endocarditis, an inflammation and infection of the lining of the heart and/or of the heart valves, can result from a bloodstream infection. People who have prosthetic heart valves or prosthetic joints have a higher risk of a systemic infection following their surgery, although these infections are not common.\r\n\r\nAnyone with a weakened immune system due to an underlying disease, such as leukemia or HIV/AIDS, or due to immunosuppressive drugs such as those given for chemotherapy is at a higher risk for blood infections as their immune system is less capable of killing the microbes that occasionally enter the blood. Bacteria and yeasts may also be introduced directly into the bloodstream through intravenous drug use or through intravenous catheters or surgical drains.\r\n\r\nFor blood cultures, multiple blood samples are usually collected for testing and from different veins to increase the likelihood of detecting the bacteria or fungi that may be present in small numbers and/or may enter the blood intermittently. This is also done to help ensure that any bacteria or fungi detected are the ones causing the infection and are not contaminants.\r\n\r\nBlood cultures are incubated for several days before being reported as negative. Some types of bacteria and fungi grow more slowly than others and/or may take longer to detect if initially present in low numbers.\r\n\r\nWhen a blood culture is positive, the specific microbe causing the infection is identified and susceptibility testing is performed to inform the healthcare practitioner which antibiotics are most likely to be effective for treatment.\r\n\r\nIn many laboratories, the blood culture testing process is automated with instruments continuously monitoring the samples for growth of bacteria or fungi. This allows for timely reporting of results and for the healthcare practitioner to direct antimicrobial therapy to the specific microbe present in the blood. Because treatment must be given as soon as possible in cases of sepsis, broad-spectrum antimicrobials that are effective against several types of bacteria are usually given intravenously while waiting for blood culture results. Antimicrobial therapy may be changed to a more targeted antibiotic therapy once the microbe causing the infection is identified.	To check for the presence of a systemic infection; to detect and identify bacteria or yeast in the blood	When you have signs or symptoms of sepsis, which may include fever, chills, fatigue, rapid breathing and/or heart rate, and/or an elevated white blood cell count	Two or more blood samples drawn from separate venipuncture sites, typically from different veins in your arms	None	Blood cultures are used to detect the presence of bacteria or fungi in the blood, to identify the type present, and to guide treatment. Testing is used to identify a blood infection (septicemia) that can lead to sepsis, a serious and life-threatening complication. Individuals with a suspected blood infection are often treated in intensive care units, so testing is often done in a hospital setting.\r\n\r\nAlthough blood samples may be used to detect viruses, this article focuses on the use of blood cultures to detect and identify bacteria and fungi. Routine blood culture media cannot grow viruses and therefore cannot detect if the person tested has virus in their blood (viremia).\r\n\r\nOther related tests that may be performed include:\r\n\r\nGram stain—a relatively quick test used to detect and identify the general type of bacteria present in other body sites, such as urine or sputum. A direct gram stain of blood is too insensitive to detect bacteria in the bloodstream.\r\nSusceptibility testing—determines the drug (antimicrobial) that may be most effective in treating the infection\r\nOften, a complete blood count (CBC) is ordered along with or prior to the blood culture to determine whether the person has an increased number of white blood cells (or in some cases, a decreased number of white blood cells), indicating a potential infection. Sometimes other testing is also performed, such as a chemistry panel to evaluate the health status of a person's organs, or a urine, sputum, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture to help identify the source of the original infection. This is especially true when a person has symptoms associated with a urinary tract infection, pneumonia, or meningitis.	Two or more blood cultures that are positive for the same bacteria or fungi means that the person tested likely has a blood infection with that microbe. The results typically identify the specific bacteria or fungi causing the infection.\r\n\r\nBlood infections are serious and need to be treated immediately, usually in a hospital. Sepsis is a complication that can be life-threatening, especially in people with weakened immune systems. Healthcare practitioners who suspect sepsis may begin patients on intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics that are effective against a wide range of bacteria while waiting for the blood culture or susceptibility testing results. When results become available, the treatment may be changed to an antimicrobial agent that is more specific for the bacteria or fungi detected in the blood cultures.\r\n\r\nIf one blood culture set is positive and one set is negative, it may mean that an infection or skin contaminant is present. The healthcare practitioner, usually the physician, will consider the person's clinical status and the type of bacteria or fungi found before making a diagnosis. Also, additional testing may be warranted in this case.	Because sepsis means that the bacteria or fungi have spread throughout the body, an affected person may experience many different symptoms of illness. As the immune system works to fight the infection, it produces many factors to kill the bacteria or fungi that can also make a person feel sick. Septicemia can cause a fall in blood pressure (shock), a rapid heart rate, and a decrease in blood flow to the brain, heart, and kidneys. It can also affect blood clotting factors, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can cause generalized bleeding. Bacteria in the blood may also spread to the joints and cause septic arthritis.\r\n\r\nRecent innovations in blood culture testing have involved the development of testing methods that will quickly identify the microbes present once a blood culture is positive.\r\n\r\nRapid tests are available that can detect several different types of bacteria that are commonly known to cause infections of the blood. They can identify types such as methicillin-resistant Staphylcoccus aureus (MRSA), which is typically difficult to treat, and gram negative rods such as E. coli that live in the gastrointestinal tract. Rapid identification can facilitate treatment with appropriate antibiotics.\r\n\r\nMedical researchers are also making progress on developing tests that will speed up the diagnosis-to-appropriate treatment time by:\r\n\r\nIdentifying common pathogenic microbes directly from the blood (instead of or in addition to a blood culture)\r\nHelping to rule out sepsis by distinguishing between infection-positive inflammation and infection-negative inflammation\r\nMore rapidly determining antibiotic susceptibilities (appropriate antibiotic treatment)

Heart failure, including congestive heart failure (CHF), causes the heart to become less effective at circulating blood. As a result, blood backs up into the legs, hands, feet, lungs and liver, causing swelling, shortness of breath, and fatigue. This test measures the amount of digoxin in the blood.\r\n\r\nDigoxin is prescribed to alleviate some symptoms of heart failure. It strengthens the contractions of the heart and helps it to pump blood more efficiently. Digoxin also helps control the heart rate and abnormal heart rhythms known as arrhythmias. It will not cure heart failure or arrhythmias, which are chronic conditions, but can help to manage the symptoms along with diet, exercise, and other medications.\r\n\r\nDigoxin levels must be monitored because the drug has a narrow safety range. If the level in the blood is too low, symptoms may recur. If the level is too high, toxicity may occur. Digoxin dosage may be adjusted based on levels measured.	To determine if the concentration of digoxin in your blood is at a therapeutic level or to detect toxic levels of the drug	After the start of digoxin therapy and at regular intervals to ensure that drug levels are within therapeutic range (not too low or too high as to be toxic)	A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm	No special preparation is needed, but timing of sample collection is important. When having your blood drawn, tell the person taking your sample when you took your last dose of digoxin.	A digoxin test is used to monitor the concentration of the drug in the blood. The dose of digoxin prescribed may be adjusted depending on the level measured. A healthcare practitioner may order one or more digoxin tests when a person begins treatment to determine if the initial dosage is within therapeutic range and then order it at regular intervals to ensure that the therapeutic level is maintained. A digoxin test may also be used to determine if someone's symptoms are due to an insufficient amount of the drug or to digoxin toxicity.	For congestive heart failure, the ideal range of levels of digoxin in the blood, known as the therapeutic range, may be between 0.5 and 0.8 ng/mL. Each person's response to medications is different. Many factors, including kidney function and concurrent medications, may be involved. If someone's symptoms do not improve or if the person is experiencing side effects, then the healthcare provider may need to adjust the digoxin dose up or down according to that person's needs.	When prescribed digoxin, you should discuss with your healthcare provider and pharmacist all other prescription and over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. These can affect the level of digoxin in the blood and its effectiveness. Be sure to notify your healthcare provider about any changes in use of these products while you are taking digoxin.\r\n\r\nPrescription drugs that can interact with digoxin include: quinidine, flecainide, verapamil, amiodarone, amiodarone, azole antifungals (such as itraconazole, ketoconazole), cyclosporine, lapatinib, macrolide antibiotics (such as clarithromycin, erythromycin), propafenone, ranolazine, rifampin, and ciprofloxacin. Herbal remedies such as St. John's wort, oleander, and lily of the valley may affect levels of digoxin in the blood. Eating licorice may also affect blood levels of the drug.\r\n\r\nDigoxin is primarily cleared from the system by the kidneys. When someone has kidney problems, the person's healthcare provider may want to monitor kidney function and blood potassium levels since kidney dysfunction and low levels of potassium can result in symptoms of digoxin toxicity.\r\n\r\nDigoxin toxicity can be aggravated by potassium and magnesium levels, so a healthcare provider may monitor electrolytes and other ions like magnesium as well.\r\n\r\nIn cases where toxic levels of digoxin are found, a healthcare practitioner may administer a specialized antidote (digoxin immune FAB) to reverse the effects of the digoxin.

As electrically charged particles, electrolytes help move nutrients into and wastes out of the body's cells, maintain a healthy water balance, and help stabilize the body's acid/base (pH) level.\r\n\r\nThe electrolyte panel measures the blood levels of the main electrolytes in the body: sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-; sometimes reported as total CO2).\r\n\r\nA person's diet provides sodium, potassium, and chloride. The kidneys help maintain proper levels by reabsorption or by elimination into the urine. The lungs provide oxygen and regulate CO2. The CO2 is produced by the body and is in balance with bicarbonate. The overall balance of these chemicals is an indication of the functional well-being of several basic body functions. They are important in maintaining a wide range of body functions, including cardiac and skeletal muscle contraction and nerve impulse conduction.\r\n\r\nAny disease or condition that affects the amount of fluid in the body, such as dehydration, or affects the lungs, kidneys, metabolism, or breathing has the potential to cause a fluid, electrolyte, or pH imbalance (acidosis or alkalosis). Normal pH must be maintained within a narrow range of 7.35-7.45 and electrolytes must be in balance to ensure the proper functioning of metabolic processes and the delivery of the right amount of oxygen to tissues. (For more on this, see the condition article on Acidosis and Alkalosis and also on Dehydration.)\r\n\r\nA related "test" is the anion gap, which is a value calculated using the results of an electrolyte panel. It reflects the difference between the positively charged ions (called cations) and the negatively charged ions (called anions). An abnormal anion gap is non-specific but can suggest certain kinds of metabolic or respiratory disorders or the presence of toxic substances.	To detect a problem with the body's electrolyte balance	As part of routine health screening or when your healthcare provider suspects that you have an imbalance of one of the electrolytes (usually sodium or potassium) or an acid-base imbalance	A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm	None	The electrolyte panel is used to identify an electrolyte, fluid, or pH imbalance (acidosis or alkalosis). It is frequently ordered as part of a routine physical. It may be ordered by itself or as a component of a basic metabolic panel (BMP) or a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). These panels can include other tests such as BUN, creatinine, and glucose.\r\n\r\nElectrolyte measurements may be used to help investigate conditions that cause electrolyte imbalances such as dehydration, kidney disease, lung diseases, or heart conditions. Repeat testing may then also be used to monitor treatment of the condition causing the imbalance.\r\n\r\nSince electrolyte and acid-base imbalances can be present with a wide variety of acute and chronic illnesses, the electrolyte panel is frequently used to evaluate patients both in the emergency room as well as hospitalized patients.\r\n\r\nThe electrolyte panel typically includes tests for:\r\n\r\nSodium—most of the body's sodium is found in extracellular fluid, outside of the body's cells, where it helps to regulate the amount of water in the body.\r\nPotassium—this electrolyte is found mainly inside the body's cells. A small but vital amount of potassium is found in the plasma, the liquid portion of the blood. Monitoring potassium is important as small changes in the potassium level can affect the heart's rhythm and ability to contract.\r\nChloride—this electrolyte moves in and out of the cells to help maintain electrical neutrality and its level usually mirrors that of sodium.\r\nBicarbonate—the main job of bicarbonate (or total CO2, an estimate of bicarbonate), which is released and reabsorbed by the kidneys, is to help maintain a stable pH level (acid-base balance) and, secondarily, to help maintain electrical neutrality.\r\nThe results for an electrolyte panel may also include a calculation for anion gap \r\n\r\nIf a person has an imbalance of a single electrolyte, such as sodium or potassium, the health practitioner may order repeat testing of that individual electrolyte, monitoring the imbalance until it resolves. If someone has an acid-base imbalance, the health practitioner may also order tests for blood gases, which measure the pH and oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in an arterial blood sample, to help evaluate the severity of the imbalance and monitor its response to treatment.	High or low electrolyte levels can be caused by several conditions and diseases. Generally, they are affected by how much is consumed in the diet and absorbed by the body, the amount of water in a person's body, and the amount eliminated by the kidneys. They are also affected by some hormones such as aldosterone, a hormone that conserves sodium and promotes the elimination of potassium, and natriuretic peptides, which increase elimination of sodium by the kidneys.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the amount of water in a person's body, people whose kidneys are not functioning properly, for example, may retain excess fluid. This results in a dilution effect on sodium and chloride so that they fall below normal concentrations. On the other hand, people who experience severe fluid loss may show an increase in potassium, sodium, and chloride concentrations. Some conditions such as heart disease and diabetes may also affect the fluid and electrolytes balance in the body and cause abnormal levels of electrolytes.\r\n\r\nKnowing which electrolytes are out of balance can help a health practitioner determine the underlying cause and make decisions about treatment to restore proper balance. Left untreated, an electrolyte imbalance can lead to various problems, including dizziness, cramps, irregular heartbeat, and possibly death.	Certain drugs, such as anabolic steroids, corticosteroids, laxatives, cough medicines, and oral contraceptives, may cause increased levels of sodium. Other drugs, such as diuretics, carbamazepine, and tricyclic antidepressants, may cause decreased levels of sodium.\r\n\r\nDrugs that affect sodium blood levels will also cause changes in chloride. Taking substantially more than the recommended dosage of antacids can also cause low chloride levels.\r\n\r\nSome drugs may increase bicarbonate (total CO2) levels. These include, among others, fludrocortisone, barbiturates, hydrocortisone, loop diuretics, and steroids.   Drugs that may decrease bicarbonate (total CO2) levels include methicillin, nitrofurantoin, tetracycline, thiazide diuretics, and triamterene.\r\n\r\nSome diuretics, which may be used for people with disorders such as high blood pressure or kidney disease, tend to lower potassium levels to dangerously low levels. To avoid this problem, a health practitioner may prescribe a potassium-sparing diuretic.\r\n\r\nA non-physiological cause of a high potassium level in a patient sample is leakage from the blood cells if the sample is not handled carefully or is delayed in transport to the lab. If a significant amount of potassium leaks from cells, it can contribute to a falsely high test result. When a healthcare provider suspects that a potassium result is not consistent with a patient's condition, the test for potassium may be repeated.

The small amount of ferritin that is released and circulates in the blood is a reflection of the total amount of iron stored in the body. This test measures the amount of ferritin in the blood.\r\n\r\nIron is an essential trace element and nutrient that, among other functions, is necessary for the production of healthy red blood cells (RBCs). The body cannot produce iron and must absorb it from the foods we eat or from supplements.\r\n\r\nIn healthy people, most of the iron absorbed by the body is incorporated into the hemoglobin of red blood cells. Most of the remaining is stored as ferritin or as hemosiderin, with additional small amounts used to produce other proteins such as myoglobin and some enzymes. Ferritin and hemosiderin are present primarily in the liver but also in the bone marrow, spleen, and skeletal muscles.\r\n\r\nWhen the level of iron is insufficient to meet the body's needs, the level of iron in the blood drops, iron stores are depleted and ferritin levels decrease. This may occur because:\r\n\r\nNot enough iron is consumed (either foods or supplements)\r\nThe body is unable to absorb iron from the foods eaten in conditions such as celiac disease\r\nThere is an increased need for iron such as during pregnancy or childhood, or due to a condition that causes chronic blood loss (e.g., peptic ulcer, colon cancer).\r\nInsufficient levels of circulating and stored iron may eventually lead to iron deficiency anemia (decreased hemoglobin). In the early stage of iron deficiency, no physical effects are usually seen and the amount of iron stored may be significantly depleted before any signs or symptoms of iron deficiency develop. If a person is otherwise healthy and anemia develops over a long period of time, symptoms seldom appear before the hemoglobin in the blood drops below the lower limit of normal.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the iron-deficiency progresses, symptoms eventually begin to appear. The most common symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headaches and pale skin. (Read the article on Anemia to learn more.)\r\n\r\nConversely, iron storage and ferritin levels increase when more iron is absorbed than the body needs. Absorbing too much iron over time can lead to the progressive buildup of iron compounds in organs and may eventually cause their dysfunction and failure. An example of this is hemochromatosis, a rare genetic disease in which the body absorbs too much iron, even on a normal diet. Additionally, iron overload can occur when a person undergoes repeated blood transfusions.	To determine your body's total iron storage capacity; to help diagnose iron deficiency or iron overload	When you have low hemoglobin and hematocrit on a complete blood count (CBC); when your healthcare practitioner suspects that you may have too little iron (iron deficiency) or too much iron (iron overload) in the body	A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm	You may be instructed to have your blood drawn in the morning and/or fast for 12 hours before the test; in this case, only water is permitted. Follow any instructions from your healthcare practitioner and/or from the laboratory performing the test.	The ferritin test is used to assess a person's iron stores in the body. The test is often ordered along with an iron level and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC, calculated based on blood level of transferrin) to detect a low iron level (iron deficiency) or too much iron in the body (iron overload) as well as to assess the severity of these conditions.	The early stage of iron deficiency is the slow depletion of iron stores. This means there is still enough iron to make red cells but the stores are being used up without adequate replacement. The serum iron level may be normal in this stage, but the ferritin level will be low.\r\n\r\nAs iron deficiency continues, all of the stored iron is used and the body tries to compensate by producing more transferrin to increase iron transport. The serum iron level continues to decrease and transferrin and TIBC and UIBC increase. As this stage progresses, fewer and smaller red blood cells are produced, eventually resulting in iron deficiency anemia. Transferrin saturation is decreased with iron deficiency.\r\n\r\nIron overload\r\nIf the iron level and transferrin saturation are high, the TIBC, UIBC and ferritin are normal and the person has a clinical history consistent with iron overdose, then it is likely that the person has iron poisoning. Iron poisoning occurs when a large dose of iron is taken all at once or over a short period of time. Iron poisoning in children is almost always acute, occurring in children who ingest their parents' iron supplements. In some cases, acute iron poisoning can be fatal. In patients with chronic iron overload, ferritin levels increase.\r\n\r\nA person who has mutations in the HFE gene is diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis. However, while many people who have hemochromatosis will have no symptoms for their entire life, others will start to develop symptoms such as joint pain, abdominal pain, and weakness in their 30's or 40's. Men are affected more often than women because women lose blood during their reproductive years through menstruation.\r\n\r\nIron overload may also occur in people who have hemosiderosis and in those who have had repeated transfusions. This may occur with sickle cell anemia, thalassemia major, or other forms of transfusion-dependent anemia. The iron from each transfused unit of blood stays in the body, eventually causing a large buildup in the tissues. Some persons with alcoholism and with chronic liver disease also develop iron overload.	Normally, most ferritin is found inside of cells with only a small amount in the blood. Patients with iron overload have high ferritin levels. However, ferritin levels can become elevated under certain condition (e.g., acute illness) even though the total amount of iron in the body is normal.

Using glucose for energy production depends on insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin facilitates transport of glucose into the body's cells and directs the liver to store excess energy as glycogen for short-term storage and/or as triglycerides in adipose (fat) cells.\r\n\r\nNormally, blood glucose rises slightly after a meal and insulin is released by the pancreas into the blood in response, with the amount corresponding to the size and content of the meal. As glucose moves into the cells and is metabolized, the level in the blood drops and the pancreas responds by slowing, then stopping the release of insulin.\r\n\r\nIf the blood glucose level drops too low, such as might occur in between meals or after a strenuous workout, glucagon (another pancreatic hormone) is secreted to induce the liver to turn some glycogen back into glucose, raising the blood glucose level. If the glucose/insulin feedback mechanism is working properly, the amount of glucose in the blood remains fairly stable. If the balance is disrupted and the glucose level in the blood rises, then the body tries to restore the balance, both by increasing insulin production and by eliminating excess glucose in the urine.\r\n\r\nThere are a few different conditions that may disrupt the balance between glucose and the pancreatic hormones, resulting in high or low blood glucose. The most common cause is diabetes. Diabetes is a group of disorders associated with insufficient insulin production and/or a resistance to the effects of insulin. People with untreated diabetes are not able to process and use glucose normally. Those who are not able to produce any or enough insulin (and typically have diabetes autoantibodies) are diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes. Those who are resistant to insulin and may or may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of it may have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nSevere, acute changes in blood glucose, either high or low, can be life-threatening, causing organ failure, brain damage, coma, and, in extreme cases, death. Chronically high blood glucose levels can cause progressive damage to body organs such as the kidneys, eyes, heart and blood vessels, and nerves. Chronic hypoglycemia can lead to brain and nerve damage.\r\n\r\nSome women may develop gestational diabetes, which is hyperglycemia that occurs during pregnancy. If untreated, this can cause these mothers to give birth to large babies who may have low glucose levels. Women who have had gestational diabetes may or may not go on to develop diabetes.	To determine if your blood glucose level is within a healthy range; to screen for and diagnose diabetes and prediabetes and to monitor for high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) or low blood glucose (hypoglycemia); to check for glucose in your urine	Blood glucose: when you are older than 45 years or have risk factors for diabetes; when you have symptoms suggesting high or low blood glucose; during pregnancy; when you are diabetic, self-checks up to several times a day to monitor blood glucose levels\r\n\r\nUrine glucose: usually as part of a urinalysis	A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or a drop of blood from a skin prick; sometimes a random urine sample is used. Some diabetics may use a continuous glucose monitor, which uses a small sensor wire inserted beneath the skin of the abdomen to measure blood glucose at frequent intervals and provides a result.	In general, it is recommended that you fast (nothing to eat or drink except water) for at least 8 hours before having a blood glucose test. For people with diabetes, glucose levels are often checked both while fasting and after meals to provide the best control of diabetes. For random, timed, and post-meal glucose tests, follow your health practitioner's instructions.	The following tests may be used for screening and diagnosis of type 1, type 2 or prediabetes. (Gestational diabetes testing is different—see below.) If the initial screening result from one of the tests is abnormal, the test is repeated on another day. The repeat result must also be abnormal to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes.\r\n\r\nFasting glucose (fasting blood glucose, FBG) – this test measures the level of glucose in the blood after fasting for at least 8 hours.\r\n2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) – for this test, the person has a fasting glucose test done (see above), then drinks a 75-gram glucose drink. Another blood sample is drawn 2 hours after the glucose drink. This protocol "challenges" the person's body to process the glucose. Normally, the blood glucose level rises after the drink and stimulates the pancreas to release insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin allows the glucose to be taken up by cells. As time passes, the blood glucose level is expected to decrease again. When a person is unable to produce enough insulin, or if the body's cells are resistant to its effects (insulin resistance), then less glucose is transported from the blood into cells and the blood glucose level remains high.\r\nA different test called hemoglobin A1c may be used as an alternative to glucose testing for screening and diagnosis. (For more, see the article on A1c.).\r\nSometimes a blood sample may be drawn and glucose measured when a person has not been fasting, for example, when a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is performed. If the result is abnormal, it is typically followed up with a fasting blood glucose test or a GTT.\r\n\r\nGlucose blood tests are also used to screen pregnant women for gestational diabetes between their 24th and 28th week of pregnancy. The American Diabetes Association and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend that pregnant women not previously known to have diabetes be screened and diagnosed, using either a one-step or two-step approach. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends the two-step approach.\r\n\r\nOne-step 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). After a fasting glucose level is measured, a woman is given a 75-gram dose of glucose to drink and her glucose levels are measured at 1 hour and 2 hours after the dose. Only one of the values needs to be above a cutoff value for diagnosis.\r\nTwo-step\r\nPerform a glucose challenge test as a screen: a woman is given a 50-gram glucose dose to drink and her blood glucose level is measured after 1 hour.\r\nIf the challenge test is abnormal, perform a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test. After a woman's fasting glucose level is measured, she is given a 100-gram glucose dose and her glucose is measured at timed intervals. If at least two of the glucose levels at fasting, 1 hour, 2 hour, or 3 hour are above a certain level, then a diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made.\r\nGlucose testing is also used to test women who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes 6-12 weeks after they have delivered their baby to detect persistent diabetes.	Low to undetectable urine glucose results are considered normal. Any condition that raises blood glucose such as diabetes or the other conditions listed above also has the potential to elevate the concentration of glucose in the urine.\r\n\r\nIncreased urine glucose may be seen with medications, such as estrogens and chloral hydrate, and with some forms of kidney disease. Some people naturally leak glucose in their urine when blood levels are normal. Some medications used to treat diabetes work by increasing the elimination of glucose in the urine.	Extreme stress can cause a temporary rise in blood glucose. This can be a result of, for example, trauma, surgery, heart attack or stroke.\r\n\r\nDrugs, including corticosteroids, tricyclic antidepressants, diuretics, epinephrine, estrogens (birth control pills and hormone replacement), lithium, phenytoin, and salicylates, can increase glucose levels, while drugs such as acetaminophen and anabolic steroids can decrease levels.

They are formed from very large cells called megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and are released into the blood to circulate. The platelet count is a test that determines the number of platelets in a person's sample of blood.\r\n\r\nWhen there is an injury to a blood vessel or tissue and bleeding begins, platelets help stop bleeding in three ways. They:\r\n\r\nAdhere to the injury site\r\nClump together (aggregate) with other platelets\r\nRelease chemical compounds that stimulate further aggregation of other platelets\r\nThese steps result in the formation of a loose platelet plug at the site of the injury in a process called primary hemostasis. At the same time, activated platelets support the coagulation cascade, a series of steps that involves the sequential activation of proteins called clotting factors. This secondary hemostasis process results in the formation of strands of fibrin that weave through the loose platelet plug, form a fibrin net, and compress to form a stable clot that remains in place until the injury has healed. When the clot is no longer needed, other factors break the clot down and remove it.\r\n\r\nEach component of primary and secondary hemostasis must be present, activated at the right time, and functioning properly for adequate clotting. If there are insufficient platelets, or if platelets are not functioning normally, a stable clot may not form and a person may be at an increased risk of excessive bleeding.\r\n\r\nPlatelets survive in the circulation about 8 to 10 days, and the bone marrow must continually produce new platelets to replace those that degrade, are used up, and/or are lost through bleeding. Determining the number of platelets in blood with a platelet count can help diagnose a range of disorders having to do with too few or too many platelets.	To determine the number of platelets in a sample of your blood as part of a health exam; to screen for, diagnose, or monitor conditions that affect the number of platelets, such as a bleeding disorder, a bone marrow disease, or other underlying condition	As part of a routine complete blood count (CBC); when you have episodes of unexplained or prolonged bleeding or other symptoms that may be due to a platelet disorder	A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or by a fingerstick (children and adults) or heelstick (newborns)	None	A platelet count is used to detect the number of platelets in the blood. The test is included in a complete blood count (CBC), a panel of tests often performed as part of a general health examination.\r\n\r\nPlatelets are tiny fragments of cells that are essential for normal blood clotting. A platelet count may be used to screen for or diagnose various diseases and conditions that can cause problems with clot formation. It may be used as part of the workup of a bleeding disorder, bone marrow disease, or excessive clotting disorder, to name just a few.\r\n\r\nThe test may be used as a monitoring tool for people with underlying conditions or undergoing treatment with drugs known to affect platelets. It may also be used to monitor those being treated for a platelet disorder to determine if therapy is effective.\r\n\r\nA platelet count may be performed in conjunction with one or more platelet function tests, which assess the function of platelets, and other tests that evaluate coagulation such as PT and PTT. If results are not within the normal interval, a number of other tests may be performed to help give clues as to the cause. Sometimes a blood smear may be done in follow up to examine the platelets under a microscope. This would help to determine, for example, whether platelets might truly be low in number or have clumped together during testing. (See Common Questions #3 and #4 for more on this.)	A low platelet count, also called thrombocytopenia, and accompanying signs and symptoms may be caused by a number of conditions and factors. The causes typically fall into one of two general categories:\r\n\r\nDisorders in which the bone marrow cannot produce enough platelets\r\nConditions in which platelets are used up (consumed) or destroyed faster than normal\r\nExamples of conditions causing a low platelet count include:\r\n\r\nIdiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP), also known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura, is the result of antibody production against platelets.\r\nViral infections such as mononucleosis, hepatitis, HIV or measles\r\nCertain drugs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, some antibiotics (including those containing sulfa), colchicine and indomethacin, H2-blocking agents, hydralazine, isoniazid, quinidine, thiazide diuretics, and tolbutamide, are just a few that have been associated with drug-induced decreased platelet counts.\r\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) results in low platelets when a person who is on or received heparin therapy develops an antibody. (For more on this, see the article on HIT Antibody)\r\nLeukemia, lymphoma, or another cancer that has spread (metastasized) to the bone marrow—people with cancers often experience excessive bleeding due to a significantly decreased number of platelets. As the number of cancer cells increases in the bone marrow, normal bone marrow cells are crowded out, resulting in fewer platelet-producing cells.\r\nAplastic anemia—a condition in which the production of all blood cells is significantly reduced\r\nLong-term bleeding problems (e.g., chronic bleeding from stomach ulcers)\r\nSepsis, especially that caused by a serious bacterial infection with Gram-negative bacteria\r\nCirrhosis\r\nAutoimmune disorders, such as lupus, where the body's immune system produces antibodies that attack its own organs or tissues, causing increased destruction of platelets\r\nChemotherapy or radiation therapy, which may affect the bone marrow's ability to produce platelets\r\nPlatelet consumption may be observed in various diseases and conditions. For example, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) can result in fewer circulating platelets in the blood.\r\nExposure to toxic chemicals, such as pesticides, arsenic, or benzene\r\nIf the platelet count falls below 20,000 per microliter, spontaneous bleeding may occur and is considered a life-threatening risk. A person with a very low count may be given platelets through a transfusion. See Blood and Blood Components in the Blood Banking article for more details.\r\n\r\nA high platelet count may be referred to as thrombocytosis. This is usually the result of an existing condition (also called secondary or reactive thrombocytosis) such as:\r\n\r\nCancer, most commonly lung, gastrointestinal, ovarian, breast or lymphoma\r\nAnemia, in particular iron-deficiency anemia and hemolytic anemia\r\nInflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or rheumatoid arthritis\r\nInfectious diseases such as tuberculosis\r\nIf an individual has had their spleen removed surgically\r\nUse of birth control pills (oral contraceptives)\r\nSome conditions may cause a temporary (transitory) increased platelet count. These may include:\r\n\r\nRecovery from significant blood loss such as from trauma or major surgery\r\nAfter physical activity or exertion\r\nRecovery from excess alcohol consumption and vitamin B12 and folate deficiency\r\nRarely, thrombocytosis is caused by a bone marrow disorder. An example is thrombocythemia, also called primary or essential thrombocythemia, a rare myeloproliferative disorder in which the bone marrow produces an extremely high number of platelets. Often there are no signs and symptoms and the condition is discovered when testing is done for a health check or for other reasons.	Some people have platelets that tend to "pool" or collect (sequester) in their spleen, resulting in a low platelet count. However, these individuals typically do not experience any signs or symptoms related to this condition.\r\n\r\nLiving in high altitudes, strenuous exercise, and having recently delivered a baby (post partum) may cause increased platelet numbers. Drugs that may cause increased platelet counts include estrogen and birth control pills (oral contraceptives).\r\n\r\nMildly decreased platelet counts may be seen in women before menstruation. Up to 5% of pregnant women may have a lower platelet count at term.\r\n\r\nInherited disorders caused by genetic defects in platelets include Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia, Bernard-Soulier disease, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, May-Hegglin syndrome, and Down syndrome. The occurrence of these genetic abnormalities, however, is relatively rare.

This test measures the amount of triglycerides in the blood.\r\n\r\nMost triglycerides are found in fat (adipose) tissue, but some triglycerides circulate in the blood to provide fuel for muscles to work. After a person eats, an increased level of triglycerides is found in the blood as the body converts the energy not needed right away into fat. Triglycerides move via the blood from the gut to adipose tissue for storage. In between meals, triglycerides are released from fat tissue to be used as an energy source for the body. Most triglycerides are carried in the blood by lipoproteins called very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).\r\n\r\nHigh levels of triglycerides in the blood are associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), although the reason for this is not well understood. Certain factors can contribute to high triglyceride levels and to risk of CVD, including lack of exercise, being overweight, smoking cigarettes, consuming excess alcohol, and having medical conditions such as diabetes and kidney disease.	To assess your risk of developing heart disease; to monitor effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy	Screening: as part of a lipid profile during a regular medical exam at least once every four to six years for adults; for children, at least once between the ages of 9 and 11 and again between the ages of 17 and 21\r\n\r\nMonitoring: may be done more frequently if you have risk factors for heart disease and/or if you are being treated for unhealthy lipid levels	A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or from a fingerstick	Current standards recommend that testing be done when you are fasting. For 9 to 12 hours before the test, only water is permitted. In addition, alcohol should not be consumed for 24 hours just before the test. Your healthcare practitioner may decide that you may be tested without fasting. Follow any instructions you are given and tell the person drawing your blood whether or not you have fasted.	Blood tests for triglycerides are usually part of a lipid profile that is used to help identify an individual's risk of developing heart disease and to help make decisions about what treatment may be needed if there is borderline or high risk. As part of a lipid profile, it may be used to monitor people who have risk factors for heart disease, those who have had a heart attack, or those who are being treated for high lipid and/or high triglyceride levels.\r\n\r\nResults of the cholesterol test and other components of the lipid profile are used along with other known risk factors of heart disease to develop a plan of treatment and follow-up. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes, such as diet or exercise programs, or lipid-lowering drugs, such as statins.	In general, healthy lipid levels help to maintain a healthy heart and lower the risk of heart attack or stroke. A healthcare practitioner will take into consideration the results of each component of the lipid profile as well as other risk factors to help determine a person's overall risk of heart disease, whether treatment is necessary and, if so, which treatment will best help to lower the person's risk.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII) provided the guidelines for evaluating lipid levels and determining treatment. In 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued guidelines for adults that made recommendations on who should receive cholesterol-lowing therapy.\r\n\r\nWhen triglycerides are very high (greater than 1000 mg/dL (11.30 mmol/L)), there is a risk of developing pancreatitis in children and adults. Treatment to lower triglycerides should be started as soon as possible.	If you are diabetic and your blood sugar (glucose) is out of control, triglycerides may be very high.\r\n\r\nTriglycerides change dramatically in response to meals, increasing as much as 5 to 10 times higher than fasting levels just a few hours after eating. Even fasting levels vary considerably day to day. Therefore, modest changes in fasting triglycerides measured on different days are not considered to be abnormal.\r\n\r\nCertain drugs such as corticosteroids, protease inhibitors for HIV, beta blockers, and estrogens can increase blood triglyceride levels.\r\n\r\nThere is increasing interest in measuring triglycerides in people who have not fasted. The reason is that a non-fasting sample may be more representative of the "usual" circulating level of triglyceride since most of the day blood lipid levels reflect post-meal (post-prandial) levels rather than fasting levels. However, it is not yet certain how to interpret non-fasting levels for evaluating risk so, at present, there is no change in the current recommendations for fasting prior to tests for lipid levels.
