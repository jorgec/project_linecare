                Interest based advertising is the collection of data from
                different sources and across different platforms in order to
                predict an individual’s preferences or interest and to deliver to
                that individual, or his/her computer, smart phone or tablet,
                advertising based on his/her assumed preference or interest
                inferred from the collection of data pertaining to that individual
                or others who may have a similar profile or similar interests.

                We work with a variety of third parties to attempt to understand
                the profiles of the individuals who are most likely to be
                interested in the Linecare products or services so that we can
                send them promotional emails, or serve our advertisements to them
                on the websites and mobile apps of other entities.
            </p>

                These third parties include: (a) advertising networks, which

                attribution partners, which measure the effectiveness of certain
                advertisements; and (3) business partners, which collect
                information when a person views or interacts with one of their

            </div>
            <p class="card-text">
                Philippines law requires that operators of websites and online
                services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some
                browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these
                features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the
                website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the
                user does not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a
                common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we
                do not currently respond to Do Not Track signal. We continue to
                work with the online industry to define a common understanding of
                how to treat Do Not Track signals.

                you want to opt out of this online behavioral advertising, visit

                This will opt you out of many – but not all - of the

                Other third-party Sites provide visitors with the ability to
                opt-out of receiving interest-based ads on their Sites that you
                need to control through your settings on that Site. For example,
